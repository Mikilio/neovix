### Neovim Configuration

Welcome to my Neovim configuration!

Carefully copy-pasted from the finest repo's only, this configuration has been designed for one purpose only:

To make me feel like my Vim is the best.

Inspired by NixVim I came to name it neovix. In German this sounded ironically
fitting, as I spent an unnecessary amount of time reconfiguring my perfectly
functional Neovim again just to fulfill the need to have even more Nix in my
life.

The setup was inspired by really all configurations featured on NixVim.
The base for the repo structure was niksingh710/nvix.
